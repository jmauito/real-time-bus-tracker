## Description

Real-time tracking of the location of buses from line 1 in Boston. This is an exercise proposal by Dr. Abel Sanchez (abelsan). In this version, all buses from the line are tracked, this is an improvement on the original exercise that tracked only one bus. In addition, the structure of files was improved.

## How to run

` const token = 'YOUR_TOKEN' `

IMPORTANT: Do not publish your token in repos.

- Open the real-time-bus-tracker.html in navigator.

- Click in the Start Tracking button.
